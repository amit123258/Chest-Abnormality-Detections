# Chest-Abnormality-Detections
The Chest Abnormality Detection project aims to classify chest X-ray images into three categories:

Normal Chest
Bacterial Pneumonia
Viral Pneumonia
This project leverages machine learning techniques to assist in the early and accurate detection of chest abnormalities, providing support for medical professionals in diagnosing respiratory conditions.

Key Features:
Dataset:
The model is trained and tested on a labeled dataset of chest X-ray images, containing examples of normal, bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia cases.

Model Architecture:
A deep learning approach, likely using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is implemented to extract features from X-ray images and classify them into the appropriate category.

Performance Metrics:
Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Applications:
This system can serve as a preliminary diagnostic tool for radiologists, reducing the workload and assisting in identifying cases that require urgent attention.

Benefits:
Speed: Provides quick preliminary analysis compared to traditional methods.
Accuracy: Enhances the detection of bacterial and viral pneumonia, reducing misdiagnoses.
Scalability: Can be deployed in hospitals, clinics, or remote areas with limited medical expertise.
This project contributes to the healthcare sector by enabling AI-powered diagnostics and improving the accuracy and efficiency of detecting chest abnormalities.
